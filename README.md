# IC2020
IC2020 is the browser-based physics simulator for teaching chemistry and physics by LBHS.

Built in Unity 2018.3.14f1 for WebGL

New features: July 30 SOGO VERSION 3.4--IONIC BONDING MODEL
Cube colliders provide perpetual motion (models constant temperature)
Ionic bonding outcomes HIGHLY DEPENDENT on bounciness of atoms/ions--try NEGATIVE K-VALUE to observe this (blue = bounciness 


# To-Do
-different shapes (triangles)

-Water molecule

-add/make flasky

-inital IC2020 start menu (load file stuff)

-save system

-forces arrow

-textures for atoms (+/-)

-speed slider

-advanced tab (empty, settings, save)

-right click on atoms

-time slider?

# Known bugs
-✔️physics keeps calculating forces while paused

-✔️table cannot retract/open while paused

-loss of energy SOLVED IN SOGO VERSION (JULY 30)

-drag only allows moving opjects once while paused

-stange table animation

-WebGl export leads to a bunch of pink circles

-use separate branches
